we ran programs on a ssh connected raspberry pi:
1. we connected
2. using nano text editor we made .py files with simple programs
3. ran them on the pi
4. made program to list odd numbers
5. made program to calculate grades of a class and list quantities of each grade

I run Ubuntu through VirtualBox, I noticed the terminal lagging significantly in class. The virtual machine had only 4GB out of my 16GB
RAM allocated, which I believe made it slow. So I changed the setting to 8 after class, will see what happens next class.

Also, were lead to comment on programs (#). Will do from now on.
